# unity-dots-horde-defense

`work in progress`

I created this project to learn how to use Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack.
While I aim to create a playable game from this, it will only be a technical demo for now.

## Current Features
- Large amount of units.
- A* Pathfinding that adapts to environment changes.
- Grid based base building system.

## Demonstrations

`TODO`

## Known Problems
- Stacking units create exponentially increasing performance problems ( CreateContactsJobs )
